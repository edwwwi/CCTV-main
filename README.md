## 📌 About the Project

Smart CCTV uses computer vision to detect people in camera footage, especially during night hours. When a person is detected, the system triggers an alert to inform the user in real time.

The main goal is to provide a smart and automated security solution that helps monitor areas without constant human supervision.
